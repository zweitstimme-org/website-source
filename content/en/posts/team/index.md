We are a team of political scientists from the University of Mannheim, LMU Munich, Hertie School Berlin and HU Berlin.

Our goal is to use our statistical model to provide a broad audience with information and forecasts about the federal election that go beyond the snapshots of political sentiment provided by opinion polls (e.g., “Sunday polls“).
