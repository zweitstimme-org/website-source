We are a team of election researchers from the University of Mannheim, LMU Munich, the Hertie School Berlin, and the University of Witten/Herdecke.

Our goal is to provide a broad audience with information and forecasts about the Bundestag election using our statistical model, which goes beyond the snapshots of political sentiment provided by opinion polls (e.g., "Sunday Questions").
