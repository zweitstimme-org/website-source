In this post, we evaluate the predictions published on our site for the state elections in Saxony, Thuringia, and Brandenburg, comparing them with the actual election results. The following text refers to the forecasts published two days before the elections.

# Evaluation of the Predictions

## Saxony

![state_election_forecast_evaluation](./fig/saxony.png)

The close race between the CDU and AfD in Saxony was narrowly won by the CDU. With **31.9%**, the party’s vote share is **2.2%** higher than the forecast published two days prior and falls within the credibility interval (ranging from **24.3%** to **35.5%**). The AfD improved to **30.6%**, slightly undershooting the forecast by **0.9%**.

The Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW) was overestimated: the predicted vote share of **17.4%** is far from the actual result of **11.8%**, falling outside the 5/6 credibility interval (ranging frim **13.6% to 21.6%**).  
Both the SPD (**7.3%**) and Greens (**5.1%**) entered the state parliament, with their results aligning closely with our predictions (forecast for SPD: **6.3%**, deviation: 1.0%; forecast for Greens: **5.3%**, deviation: 0.2%). The Left Party secured **4.5%**, entering the parliament through direct mandates. This result slightly exceeded the forecast by **0.6%** (interval: **3.0% to 4.9%**). As predicted, the FDP failed to cross the five-percent threshold.

The governing CDU-SPD-Greens coalition achieved a parliamentary majority, which was uncertain before the election given the Greens' narrow entry into parliament. We had estimated the chance of this coalition achieving a majority at only **7%**. However, the **78%** likelihood we predicted for a CDU-BSW majority did not materialize due to BSW's lower-than-expected vote share. A coalition between CDU and BSW would now require either the SPD or the Greens to form a majority.

## Thuringia

As expected, with a probability of **88%**, the AfD became the strongest party, securing **32.8%** of the vote—**3.3%** above the forecast. The result still falls within the forecast’s credibility interval (**23.9% to 35.4%**).  
The CDU received **23.6%**, exceeding the predicted **20.7%** (interval: **16.5% to 25.2%**) and finishing in second place.

The Left Party saw a significant decline, ending with **13.1%**, which is **1.2%** lower than forecasted.  
As in Saxony, the BSW's vote share was overestimated: the predicted **22.9%** far exceeds the actual **15.8%**, falling outside the credibility interval (**18.0% to 27.7%**).  
The results for SPD (**6.1%**) and Greens (**3.2%**) closely matched the forecasts (SPD forecast: **6.0%**, deviation: 0.1%; Greens forecast: **3.3%**, deviation: 0.1%). Both the Greens and FDP failed to cross the five-percent threshold, with the FDP receiving only **1.1%**, well below the forecasted **2.4%** (interval: **1.8% to 3.0%**).

The election outcome complicates the formation of a majority government without the AfD. A majority is only possible with a coalition of CDU, BSW, and the Left Party. The current minority government of the Left, SPD, and Greens no longer forms a viable majority. A coalition of CDU, BSW, and SPD, which we predicted to have a **67%** chance of achieving a majority, falls just short of the necessary seats.

## Brandenburg

In Brandenburg, the predicted competition between the AfD and SPD materialized, with the SPD ultimately winning **30.9%** of the vote, slightly ahead of the AfD at **29.2%**, retaining its position as the strongest party. Both parties' results were underestimated, with the SPD's vote share narrowly falling outside the credibility interval (SPD forecast: **25.2%**, deviation: 5.7%; AfD forecast: **27.4%**, deviation: 1.8%). Before the election, we had estimated the SPD’s chance of becoming the strongest party at **35%**, while we assigned a **64%** chance to the AfD.

As in the other two states, the BSW was overestimated. However, in Brandenburg, its result of **13.5%** still falls within the credibility interval (forecast: **16.9%**, deviation: 3.4%, interval: **13.1% to 21.1%**). The CDU’s vote share of **12.1%** is also **3.1%** below the forecast. The Greens, the Left, and the FDP failed to reach the five-percent threshold, with the FDP’s **0.8%** vote share significantly below the predicted **1.9%** (deviation: 1.1%).

The incumbent coalition was voted out. A new government excluding the AfD could be formed by the SPD, BSW, and CDU, or through a grand coalition between SPD and BSW.

# Conclusion

Our predictions achieved solid accuracy, particularly for the established parties like the CDU, SPD, AfD, and Greens. However, we systematically overestimated the vote share of the Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW) across all three states. The actual vote shares for BSW consistently fell short of expectations, even falling outside the credibility intervals in Saxony and Thuringia.
